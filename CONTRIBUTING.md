Olá! 👋  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the *Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate – PT-BR* localization project!

This is a community-driven fan effort to bring the 3DS game **Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate** to Brazilian Portuguese.  
We welcome contributions of all kinds — translations, script improvements, bug fixes, or documentation help.

## 🧭 What You Can Contribute

- ✍️ **Text Translation**  
  Help translate `.txt` files extracted from `.gmd` dialogue files. Please preserve formatting tags (like `<SUB X>`, `<PAGE>`, etc).

- 🛠️ **Script Fixes/Improvements**  
  Python or batch script enhancements are welcome — performance, clarity, automation, etc.

- 🧹 **Text Cleanup**  
  Proofread translated lines for tone, grammar, and style consistency.

- 📄 **Documentation**  
  Improve or correct the README, tutorial steps, or usage guides.

## 🚫 Please Do NOT

- ❌ Upload or share any original game content (e.g., `.arc`, `.gmd`, ROMs, CIA files)
- ❌ Submit machine-translated content without review (Google Translate dumps)
- ❌ Change the tone of the original game (humor, characters, and lore should be preserved)

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Work

- Use **Citra** or a real 3DS (with GodMode9) to test translated content in-game
- Avoid line overflows and broken formatting
- Keep logs of changes in `logs/` if modifying batches

## 📂 Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `env.bat` to load environment variables
3. Use scripts in `/scripts/` for unpacking and repacking ARC/GMD files
4. Edit `.txt` files inside `/translated/`
