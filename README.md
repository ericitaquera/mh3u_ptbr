## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Windows OS**  
  Project developed and tested on Windows 10+ for compatibility with required tools

- **Python 3.x** (mandatory)  
  Required for scripting GMD text extraction, processing, and batch automation

- [ctrtool](https://github.com/3DSGuy/ctrtool) (mandatory)
  Command-line tool to extract `romfs.bin` and other 3DS filesystem content.  
  Used to unpack the dumped ROMFS from *Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate* into modifiable folders.

- [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9)  
  To extract the ROMFS from a physical cartridge or CIA file on a real 3DS

- [Kuriimu2](https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2) *(optional)*  
  GUI tool that can help explore `.arc` and `.gmd` files during translation

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) *(optional)*
  Recommended text editor for translating `.txt` files

- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) *(optional)*
  Lightweight text editor useful for quick edits to `.txt` translation files.

- [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) *(optional)*  
  Powerful hex editor useful for inspecting and modifying binary `.arc` and compressed files at the byte level.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Extract** the ROMFS using GodMode9
2. **Unpack** `.arc` containers using using Python scripts
3. **Extract and convert** `.gmd` files to `.txt` using Python scripts
4. **Translate** the `.txt` files manually or using an IA.
5. **Repack** translated `.txt` into `.gmd`, then back into `.arc`
6. **Rebuild** the ROMFS and test your changes in Citra or on a real console

## üåç Translation Guidelines

- Maintain structure and tags such as `<SUB 0>`, `<PAGE>`, etc.
- Respect in-game formatting and avoid text overflow
- Aim to preserve the original tone and intent of characters/dialogue
- Prefer natural Brazilian Portuguese phrasing over literal translations

---

## üí° Optional Tools

- **Kuriimu2** can be useful for previewing ARC/GMD contents visually  
- **Notepad++** sometimes faster and easier than VS Code for certain tasks
