## üìù Text Files

### Original Spanish Game Texts (`gmd_texts/`)

Located under:

```
gmd_texts/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*.txt
```

These are the original `.gmd` script text files extracted from the Spanish version of the game. Each file contains dialogue lines or UI messages tied to NPCs or interface elements:

Example:

* `Npc001_spa.txt` through `Npc025_spa.txt`: NPC dialogue
* `NpcName_spa.txt`: NPC name labels

### Translated Portuguese Game Texts (`gmd_texts_ptbr/`)

Located under:

```
gmd_texts_ptbr/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*.txt
```

These are the localized Portuguese versions of the `.gmd` files. They mirror the structure of the original files and are injected back into the game for patching.

Example:

* `Npc003_spa.txt`: The Portuguese translation of the dialogue spoken by NPC #003
* `Help_spa.txt`: Help menu or tutorial text

* `Npc003_spa.prompt.txt`: Prompt tailored for NPC #003‚Äôs dialogue translation
