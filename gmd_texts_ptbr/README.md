### Translated Brazilian Portuguese Game Texts (`gmd_texts_ptbr/`)

Located under:

```
gmd_texts/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*.txt
```

These are the localized Portuguese versions of the `.gmd` files. They mirror the structure of the original files and are injected back into the game for patching.

Example:

* `Npc001_spa.txt` through `Npc025_spa.txt`: NPC dialogue
* `NpcName_spa.txt`: NPC name labels
